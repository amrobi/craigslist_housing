CoLLab at Northwestern is a socio-computational linguistics research lab with an emphasis on using computational linguistics for social good. This Craiglist scraper pulls the HTML files for all listings for the Chicago area within a specified period of time. Once these pages are downloaded, a separate script pulls the relevant data, does some basic pre-processing on some text fields for organizational purposes, and saves the data as a CSV. This data will be used in future work by CoLLab to ask questions about disparities in housing listings based on factors such as neighborhood, price, and demographics.
